# Mathematica Figure Templates

This folder contains Mathematica notebooks and scripts to help you generate publication-quality scientific figures using the Wolfram Mathematica environment.  

## 📄 Contents

| File / Sub-folder | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `*.nb` / `*.wl`  | Example notebooks / scripts demonstrating how to create standard plots (line, scatter, histograms, etc.) with consistent styling and formatting. |
| `export_settings/` *(if present)* | Presets or recommended settings for exporting figures (resolution, format, font sizes, etc.). |
| `README.md` (this file) | Overview and usage instructions for the Mathematica templates folder. |

## ✅ Why Use These Templates

- Apply a **consistent visual style** across all figures — e.g., fonts, line widths, color palettes, label formats.  
- Leverage ready-made scripts to **speed up figure creation**, especially when reproducibility and reproducible styling matter.  
- Ensure figures are **publication-ready**: proper axis labels (with units), legible fonts at export size, clean layouts, no unnecessary clutter.  

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

1. Install or open Mathematica / Wolfram Language on your computer.  
2. Navigate to this folder and open the notebook (`.nb`) or script (`.wl`) you want to use.  
3. Modify the data-input section (or adapt to your data), or insert your own data.  
4. Optionally adjust style settings (colors, fonts, line thickness, figure size) — default settings follow the guide’s standards.  
5. Run the notebook / script to generate the figure.  
6. Export the figure using recommended export settings (e.g., high resolution, vector format if needed).  

## 🧑‍🏫 How This Fits Into the Overall Guide

This folder corresponds to the **“Template for figures in Mathematica”** section of the main repository structure. Together with other parts of the guide (checklist, general figure-design guide, Python templates), it offers an end-to-end workflow for generating consistent, high-quality figures — whether you prefer Python or Mathematica.  

> **Recommended workflow:**  
> 1. Use the **checklist** to plan your figure.  
> 2. Consult the **guide** for design decisions and best practices.  
> 3. Use this **Mathematica template** (or the Python one) to generate your figure.  
> 4. Review and export — ready for inclusion in reports or publications.  

## 📬 Contributions & Feedback

If you find issues (e.g., styling bugs, export problems) or want to add new template types (e.g., heat maps, 3D plots, custom color schemes), feel free to open an issue or create a pull request.
