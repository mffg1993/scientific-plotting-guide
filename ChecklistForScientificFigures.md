# ✅ Scientific Figure Checklist

A practical checklist for students and researchers to ensure that every figure communicates its message clearly, effectively, and accessibly.

---

## 1. Define the Purpose & Message
- [ ] Clearly state **what the figure is meant to show** — what question or result does it answer?
- [ ] Include **only** the data necessary to support that message.
- [ ] Avoid redundancy: don’t repeat results shown elsewhere.

---

## 2. Choose an Appropriate Plot Type
- [ ] Select a **plot type** suited to your data (e.g., scatter, line, bar, heatmap, histogram).
- [ ] Prefer **simple plots** over visually complex ones.
- [ ] If comparing multiple datasets, ensure the comparison is **fair and visually consistent**.

---

## 3. Design for Clarity and Readability
- [ ] **Label all axes**, including physical units.
- [ ] Use **consistent fonts**, sizes, and colors across all figures.
- [ ] Ensure text is **legible at publication size** (usually ≥10 pt).
- [ ] Align subplots neatly and maintain equal spacing.
- [ ] Use gridlines or frames **only if they improve readability**.

---

## 4. Use Colors and Grayscale Intentionally
- [ ] Use color to **highlight meaning**, not decoration.
- [ ] Ensure color choices are **color-blind accessible** (e.g., Okabe-Ito palette).
- [ ] Keep a **consistent color scheme** across all figures and legends.
- [ ] Avoid rainbow color maps or excessive saturation.
- [ ] Check that the figure remains interpretable in **black-and-white**.

---

## 5. Remove Clutter and Unnecessary Elements
- [ ] Eliminate 3D effects, drop shadows, and unnecessary textures.
- [ ] Simplify tick marks and axis lines.
- [ ] Use concise, informative legends — or label lines directly.
- [ ] Avoid redundant annotations or overfilled backgrounds.

---

## 6. Choose Appropriate Scale and Data Range
- [ ] Choose axis limits that **show the trend clearly** without distorting it.
- [ ] Avoid misleading scales (e.g., truncated axes).
- [ ] Use **logarithmic or symmetric scales** when appropriate.
- [ ] Ensure tick spacing and aspect ratios are **visually balanced**.

---

## 7. Add Helpful Extras (Only if Needed)
- [ ] Add **error bars, fits, trend lines**, or **annotations** when they clarify data.
- [ ] Label important points or thresholds clearly.
- [ ] Consider insets or zoomed panels only if they **add value**.
- [ ] Keep the plot uncluttered even with these extras.

---

## 8. Write Clear and Informative Captions
- [ ] Start the caption with a **1-sentence summary** of the main message.
- [ ] Explain what is plotted, the parameters or conditions, and key observations.
- [ ] Define all symbols, colors, or abbreviations.
- [ ] Avoid interpretation or discussion — that belongs in the text.
- [ ] Maintain a consistent **caption style** across figures.

---

## 9. Review and Iterate
- [ ] Ask: *Can someone unfamiliar with the data understand the figure?*
- [ ] Test readability on both **screen and print** formats.
- [ ] Cross-check data accuracy (axis limits, labels, units, legends).
- [ ] Maintain consistent formatting across all figures in the document.
- [ ] Revise after feedback — **iteration improves clarity**.
