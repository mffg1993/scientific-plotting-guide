# 📚 Resources for Scientific Plotting

This folder collects all supplementary materials that support consistent, publication-quality figure design across different platforms (Mathematica, Python, etc.).

## 🎨 Color and Accessibility
- **[ColorGuide.md](ColorGuide.md)** — explains color theory for scientific figures, perceptual colormaps, and color-blind-safe palettes.
- Includes references to standard palettes (Viridis, Cividis, ColorBrewer, etc.) and best practices for contrast and background choice.

---

## ✅ Figure Preparation Checklist
- **[FigureChecklist.md](FigureChecklist.md)** — a concise list to review before exporting figures:
  - Font consistency (Arial, Palatino, etc.)
  - Line thickness and marker size
  - Axis labeling, units, and legends
  - Color-blind accessibility
  - Export format, resolution, and padding

---

## 🔗 Additional References
- **[Scientific Colormaps](https://s-ink.org/scientific-colour-maps)d)** — curated links to:
  - Scientific plotting standards (Nature, Optica, IEEE)
  - Open colormap repositories
  - Accessibility guidelines
  - Useful software tools (e.g. Inkscape, ImageMagick)
