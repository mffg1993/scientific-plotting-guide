This repository provides a comprehensive and practical guide to producing publication-quality scientific figures using both Mathematica and Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn).
It is designed for researchers, students, and educators who want to create clear, consistent, and reproducible visualizations for papers, theses, and presentations.

The collection is inspired by common challenges in optics and photonics research—such as visualizing diffraction, interference, and parameter scans—but its lessons apply broadly to any scientific domain.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

This guide was inspired by the collaborative culture of open science and by discussions with so many colleages through out the years.  Special thanks to Prof. Ebrahim Karimi, Prof. Jeff Lundeen for their feedback on figure design standards and accessibility practices.  

The structure and recommendations draw upon insights from:
- Open-source visualization projects (Matplotlib, Scientific Colormaps, Rougier’s *Scientific Visualization* book)  
- Publication guidelines from *Nature*, *Science Advances*, and *AIP Publishing*  
- The research community’s continued efforts toward **reproducible**, **inclusive**, and **visually coherent** scientific communication.
