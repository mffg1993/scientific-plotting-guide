Scientific Plotting Guide — Mathematica & Python

This repository provides a comprehensive and practical guide to producing publication-quality scientific figures using both Mathematica and Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn).
It is designed for researchers, students, and educators who want to create clear, consistent, and reproducible visualizations for papers, theses, and presentations.

The collection is inspired by common challenges in optics and photonics research—such as visualizing diffraction, interference, and parameter scans—but its lessons apply broadly to any scientific domain.
